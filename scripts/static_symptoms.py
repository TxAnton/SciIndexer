On J. virginiana, G. juniperi-virginianae causes galls (\"cedar
apples\") on twigs and branches (see Morphology). On apple, the most
conspicuous symptoms are the appearance of the aecia and pycnia on the
leaves (see Morphology). Small yellow-orange lesions appear on the upper
surface of the leaves and petioles, within which the pycnia are formed.
Several weeks later, yellow-brown lesions (1-16.5 mm) appear on the
undersurface, within which the aecia are formed (Aldwinckle, 1990). On
susceptible cultivars, G. juniperi-virginianae can cause very severe
defoliation. Occasionally it can cause superficial brown necrotic
lesions on apple fruits, sometimes containing pycnia but rarely aecia.

All the above-ground parts of hosts can be infected by the pathogen. The
most common and characteristic symptoms are: 

\(a\) Wilt and death of flower clusters. Some or all the blossoms of a
cluster wilt and die. The dead blossoms become dry and dark-brown to
black in colour. They usually remain attached to the plant.

\(b\) Withering and death of shoots and twigs. Infected young succulent
shoots and twigs wither, turn brown and in most cases the tip of the
shoot bends in a characteristic way forming the symptom known as
'shepherd\'s crook'. 

\(c\) Leaf blight: infected leaves show either necrotic patches which
start from the margin of the leaf blade or blackening of the petiole and
leaf midrib depending on how the infection took place. 

\(d\) Fruit blight: infected fruits also turn brown to black, shrivel
and, like the blossoms, remain attached to the spur, taking on a
mummified appearance.

\(e\) Limb and trunk blight: from the infected blossoms, shoots or
fruits, the disease spreads through the spurs to larger twigs and
branches causing cankers and then may continue into the scaffold limbs
and the trunk. Cankers cause quick death of branches or the whole tree
by girdling. The cankers are recognized, externally, because their
surface is slightly sunken, varying in size and surrounded by irregular
cracks in the bark. Internally the tissues of the cankered area show a
slightly orangey red or brown discoloration which diffuses into the
healthy tissues; they are often water-soaked in appearance.

In warm, wet conditions, a whitish mucoid bacterial ooze may exude from
infected shoots, petioles, cankered bark and infected fruit and
blossoms. The ooze from infected apple shoots may have a golden colour
(for more details see Agrios, 2005; Janse, 2005).

The pathogen can infect all aerial parts of the plant: flowers, buds,
young shoots, branches and fruits. *M. fructicola* causes twig and
blossom blight, branch canker and fruit rot. Usually, the disease begins
with the appearance of necrotic spots on the petals, later covering all
parts of the flower. From flowers the infection passes to young fruiting
twigs, which subsequently dry together with leaves. Gradually, the
infection spreads to skeletal branches that can dry completely or become
covered with cankers. Gum is released from young shoots or branches
affected by the disease. In high humidity conditions, grey bunches of
spores formed in sporodochia are often found on infected tissues
(Michailides *et al*. 2007).

Brown rot on stone-fruits appears in the summer period in the phase of
fruit ripening. First, a small brown spot develops on the fruit, which
rapidly increases in size, covering the surface of the fruit. The pulp
becomes brown, softens and completely loses its taste. On the surface of
the fruit spongy, smoky grey pads are formed - these are the sporodochia
of the pathogen. Often, they are randomly scattered over surface of the
peel. Pustules are grey in *M. fructicola* and *M. laxa*, but distinctly
buff-coloured when freshly formed in *M. fructigena*. In low humidity
conditions, pustules may not develop; instead, the whole fruit shrivels
into a wrinkled mummy.

The disease on cotton appears in patches in the field and these areas do
not necessarily produce a diseased crop the next year (Uppalapati *et
al.*, 2010). The infection of the root system early in the season does
not cause above-ground symptoms (Rush *et al.*, 1984c). Symptoms only
become conspicuous during the summer, as a sudden wilting of the plant,
with or without a prior chlorosis of the leaves. The foliage droops,
turns brown and may remain hanging on the branches for a few days before
dropping off to leave a bare, dead stalk. At this stage, the roots are
dead and their surface is covered with a network of yellow-brown fungal
strands. If there is abundant water, brown to black wart-like sclerotia
are also seen on the surface roots. The cortex of the killed roots is
soft and readily peels. The conidial stage develops on the ground, near
the margin of the zone of dying plants in the form of cushion-like,
creamy yellowish masses. These spore mats are not, however, often found
in cotton fields.

In a perennial crop such as alfalfa, the disease will continue to spread
throughout each sequential growing season, with up to 30% stand loss
occurring over a single year (Mattupalli *et al.,* 2018). Surviving
alfalfa plants compensated for damage or loss to the taproot through the
development of more lateral and crown roots (Mattupalli *et al.,* 2019).

*P. citricarpa* causes diverse symptoms such as hard spot, virulent
spot, false melanose and freckle spot on fruit and necrotic lesions on
leaves and twigs (Kotzé, 1981, 2000).

The presence of *P. citricarpa *on fruit is unlikely to be confirmed
based on visual examination alone, since symptoms on fruit are variable
in appearance and often resemble those caused by other citrus pathogens
(such as *P. citriasiana, P. citrichinaensis, Diaporthe citri*,
*Mycosphaerella citri*, *Alternaria alternata *pv*. citri*,
*Septoria *spp., *Colletotrichum *spp.) or by insect, mechanical or cold
damage, particularly in the case of freckle spot (Bonants *et al*.,
2003; Snowdon, 1990; Wang *et al*., 2012; Wulandari *et al*., 2009). 

The following four types of symptoms are widely recognized as associated
with *P. citricarpa *and have been described by Kiely (1949a, 1949b,
1960): 

***Hard spot***: the most typical symptom of citrus black spot,
characterised by sunken, pale brown necrotic lesions, 3--10 mm in
diameter, with a dark reddish-brown raised border, often containing
pycnidia. A yellow halo, when the fruit is green, or a green halo, when
the fruit is yellow or orange, may appear around these lesions. Hard
spot usually appears when fruit starts maturing, even before colour
change, and on the side of the fruit most exposed to sunlight (Kotzé,
1981, 2000). 

***Freckle spot:*** cracked or speckled spots,* *grey, tan, reddish or
colourless, 1--3 mm in diameter, slightly depressed at the centre, with
no halo around them and almost always devoid of pycnidia. Freckle spots
mostly develop after the fruit has changed colour (Bonants *et
al., *2003). 

***False melanose or speckled blotch:*** usually appears on green fruit
as small, raised, dark brown to black lesions, often surrounded by dark
specks (FUNDECITRUS, 2005). The lesions are devoid of pycnidia and may
coalesce as the season progresses (CABI, 2019). This symptom is observed
in citrus-growing areas where *P. citricarpa* has been present for a
long time and when infections occur in young fruit (FUNDECITRUS, 2005;
Frare *et al*., 2019). 

***Virulent spot, spreading spot or galloping spot*:*** *sunken necrotic
lesions without defined borders mostly on mature fruit. Numerous
pycnidia eventually develop in these lesions under conditions of high
humidity (Kotzé, 2000). Virulent symptom, because, unlike the other
symptoms, it extends deeply into the mesocarp (albedo), occasionally
involving the entire thickness of the rind, causing premature fruit drop
and serious postharvest losses (Kotzé, 1981). 

Two additional types of symptoms have also been reported to occur
infrequently on citrus fruit:  *lacy spot**, ***superficial yellow
lesions with a dark yellow to brown centre, a smooth texture and no
defined margins (Aguilar-Vildoso *et al*., 2002) and *cracked
spot*, superficial slightly raised dark brown to black lesions, variable
in size, with a cracked surface and irregular margins (Goes *et al*.,
2000). 

Leaf and twigs symptoms rarely occur on orange, mandarin and other
commercial citrus species, but they are frequently present on lemons.
They appear as round, small, sunken necrotic lesions with a yellow halo
(Kotzé, 1981).

The symptomatology of the disease is characterized by the desiccation of
twigs, branches, or the whole plants, as suggested by its
internationally adopted name 'mal secco', meaning 'dry disease' in
Italian (Sicilia *et al.*, 2022). The first symptoms appear mainly in
spring as leaf vein chlorosis followed by leaf drop, and dieback of
twigs and branches (Nigro *et al.*, 2011). The disease symptoms are
induced by a phytotoxin malseccin (EFSA, 2014). A salmon pink or
brown-reddish wood discoloration under the bark of withered twigs,
infected branches, and the trunk is the most typical symptom of the
disease, which is due to gum production within the xylem vessels
(Magnano *et al.*, 1992; Sicilia *et al.*, 2022). Raised black points
within lead-grey or ash-grey areas of withered twigs indicate the
presence of pycnidia (Nigro *et al.*, 2011). The growth of sprouts from
the base of the affected branches and suckers from the rootstock are a
very common response of the host to the disease. Gradually the pathogen
affects the entire tree, which eventually dies. In addition to the more
common form of mal secco, two other forms of the disease can be
distinguished. Root infections have been characterized by a chronic,
slowly developing disease leading to a browning of the heartwood called
'mal nero' ('black disease') and a sudden death syndrome called 'mal
fulminante' which is a rapid form of the disease apparently due to root
infection (Nigro *et al.*, 2011; Dimaria *et al.*, 2023).
